A flexible database solution designed to store and manage chemical data extracted using the ChemDataExtractor [1] library (<https://github.com/CambridgeMolecularEngineering/chemdataextractor2>). It currently supports JSON and MongoDB as backends.

This project was written and maintained by the original author: Taketomo Isazawa (ti250). Project link: <https://github.com/ti250/CDEDatabase>

For this work, the package is used to handle the extraction of data records efficiently.
